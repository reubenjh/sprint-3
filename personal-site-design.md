* What is you site's primary purpose?

I feel there are two main purposes for the site. To practice applying programming techniques I learn while studying, and to be an outlet to reflect back on what I learn through blogs.

* Who is your target audience?

I guess people with an interest in programming, who are considering going on the learning journey - they're about the only people outside of myself and classmates I can imagine might be interested in the content.

* How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

Want them to read around some of the blogs, enjoy a simple uncluttered clean design, and be able to inspect and pick at the elements for their own learning.

* How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Need a good nav system, minimalistic approach and plenty of images to break up the blogs themselves and keep people's attention.
